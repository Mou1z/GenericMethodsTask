# Description

We have a program that contains a method called `ReverseArray`. The method reversed an integer array. 

In the main method, we are attempting to reverse a string array as well, however, it results in an error because the `ReverseArray` method does not support a `string` array. 

Your task is to convert the `ReverseArray` method into a **generic method** so that the program is able to reverse and display both `example` and `strExample` arrays without any errors. 

**Nothing needs to be modified in the `main` method.**

**Check:** If the program compiles and runs successfully, reversing and outputting both the `int` and `string` type arrays using the same `reverseArray` method, then your solution is correct.
